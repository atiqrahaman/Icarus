<p>We&#39;d love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.</p>
<p>Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are an individual writing original source code and you&#39;re sure you own the intellectual property, then you&#39;ll need to sign an <a href="http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html">individual CLA</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we&#39;ll add you to the official list of contributors and be able to accept your patches.</p>
